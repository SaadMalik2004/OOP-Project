# Basic Space Shooting Game 🎮🚀

## 🧑‍💻 Developer
This project was developed individually. No team members were involved.

## 📝 Project Description
**Basic Space Shooting Game** is a simple 2D arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship and shoots bullets to destroy enemy planes.

The game is built with basic game development concepts such as player movement, bullet firing, enemy spawn, collision detection, and frame switching.

## 🖥️ Game Structure

The game consists of **three main screens (frames)**:

1. **Start Screen (Frame 1):**
   - Displays a welcome interface.
   - Includes a **"Play" button** to start the game.

2. **Gameplay Screen (Frame 2):**
   - The player controls a **spaceship** that can move and shoot bullets.
   - Bullets **destroy incoming enemy planes**.
   - Basic collision logic is implemented.

3. **End Screen (Frame 3):**
   - Shown when the game ends.
   - Provides options to **Replay** or go to **Settings**.

## 🛠️ Features

- Player spaceship shooting mechanism  
- Moving enemy planes  
- Bullet-enemy collision detection  
- Frame switching (Start → Game → End)  
- Simple UI elements for navigation

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Java (or specify your language/toolkit)
- Basic 2D graphics library (e.g., Java Swing, Pygame, etc.)

## 🔁 Future Improvements

- Score tracking system  
- Background music and sound effects  
- Multiple enemy types  
- Power-ups and advanced player weapons
