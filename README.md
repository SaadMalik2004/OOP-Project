Brief Explanation of the Project:
Smart Recipe Book is a simple and user-friendly application designed to help users store, manage, and access their favorite recipes from various cuisines.

The main features include:

ðŸ”¸ Adding New Recipes: Users can add recipes from different cuisines (e.g., Italian, Pakistani, Chinese, etc.) by entering the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.

ðŸ”¸ Saving Recipes: Once added, each recipe is saved locally or in the app's memory for later use.

ðŸ”¸ Viewing Saved Recipes: Users can revisit their saved recipes anytime through a clean and organized interface.

ðŸ”¸ Categorization: Optionally, recipes can be categorized based on cuisine type or meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

This project demonstrates basic concepts of data storage, user interface design, and interaction, making it a practical and functional mini-application for cooking enthusiasts.
